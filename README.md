# hsip_remotesens_soil_nutrient
Contains (will be frequently updated) all the code (MATLAB,Python_JS) for hyperspectral image processing of remotely sensed soil images to assess nutrient (NPK) content/other soil properties

Hyperspectral images of ANY place on the earth can be obtained from www.earthexplorer.usgs.gov
Images are usually in JPEG2000 format and 600MB in size

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Work Accomplished:
Trained and used a two layer neural net in matlab using bayesian regularization to approximate soil nitrogen content function with 13 input features

Work Remaining:
Use python libs to create more complicated CNN (Deep Learning Model) for the same
Develop a GUI to pull image from earthexplorer, give NPK values for a given (latitude,longitude)
